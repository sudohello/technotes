# Project Management

## Scrum & Kanban

**Kanban**
https://www.digite.com/kanban/what-is-kanban/
Kanban is a visual system for managing work as it moves through a process. Kanban visualizes both the process (the workflow) and the actual work passing through that process. The goal of Kanban is to identify potential bottlenecks in your process and fix them so work can flow through it cost-effectively at an optimal speed or throughput.
