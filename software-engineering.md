# Software Engineering

[DSL - Domain-specific_language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)

**SRS, FRS, BRS**
SRS means software requirement specification; FRS – functional requirement specification; BRS – business requirement specification. ... A system analyst is responsible for SRS creation, while developers – for FRS. BRS is a duty of a business analyst.

Negative, or inverse, requirements state what the system will not do. Here's an example from an actual project: "All users with three or more accounts should not be migrated." Try to rephrase negative requirements into a positive sense: "The system shall migrate only users having fewer than three accounts."

**Dependency injection**
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection

In software engineering, dependency injection is a technique whereby one object (or static method) supplies the dependencies of another object. A dependency is an object that can be used (a service). An injection is the passing of a dependency to a dependent object (a client) that would use it. The service is made part of the client's state.[1] Passing the service to the client, rather than allowing a client to build or find the service, is the fundamental requirement of the pattern.

## Programming

**KebabCase**
* http://wiki.c2.com/?KebabCase
The naming style used in LispLanguage and related languages. All lowercase with - separating words.

```bash
looks-like-this
```
**Snake_case**
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case
Snake case (or snake_case) is the practice of writing compound words or phrases in which the elements are separated with one underscore character (_) and no spaces, with each element's initial letter usually lowercased within the compound and the first letter either upper or lower case—as in "foo_bar" and "Hello_world". It is commonly used in computer code for variable names, and function names, and sometimes computer filenames.[1] At least one study found that readers can recognize snake case values more quickly than camelCase.[2]

**Camel_case**
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case
Camel case (stylized as camelCase or CamelCase; also known as camel caps or more formally as medial capitals) is the practice of writing 


**Mixins**
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixin
* In object-oriented programming languages, a Mixin is a class that contains methods for use by other classes without having to be the parent class of those other classes.
* Mixins encourage code reuse and can be used to avoid the inheritance ambiguity that multiple inheritance can cause or to work around lack of support for multiple inheritance in a language.
