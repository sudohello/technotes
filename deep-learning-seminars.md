Technology is an enabler and never the end goal. Likewise, Artificial Intelligence needs to unlock the business value for their stakeholders. Given the recent breakthroughs of Deep Learning techniques in Computer Vision, Industries in India are investing heavily in AI and there by opening up new job and research opportunities.

Never before, computer vision field seemed so lucrative then today and this is the ripe time to equip yourself with it to ensure you stay relevant for the future technology businesses.

"A picture is worth a thousand words", an idiom is highly relevant in the context of AI and never before the importance of this phrase could have been understood by an AI Engineer. Answers to different types of question gives a different level of details in an image. The challenge is to ask different questions on the kind of business problems Computer Vision AI can be used to solve. Often within the business constraints like the cost, budget and market, what problems to be taken first, what kind of investment is needed and so on.
