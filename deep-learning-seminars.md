Technology is an enabler and never the end goal. Likewise, Artificial Intelligence needs to unlock the business value for their stakeholders. Given the recent breakthroughs of Deep Learning techniques in Computer Vision, Industries in India are investing heavily in AI and there by opening up new job and research opportunities.

Never before, computer vision field seemed so lucrative then today and this is the ripe time to equip yourself with it to ensure you stay relevant for the future technology businesses.

"A picture is worth a thousand words", an idiom is highly relevant in the context of AI and never before the importance of this phrase could have been understood by an AI Engineer. Answers to different types of question gives a different level of details in an image. The challenge is to ask different questions on the kind of business problems Computer Vision AI can be used to solve. Often within the business constraints like the cost, budget and market, what problems to be taken first, what kind of investment is needed and so on.

"What is real? How do you define real?"

"This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back. You take the blue pill—the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill—you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes."

"I'm trying to free your mind, Neo. But I can only show you the door. You're the one that has to walk through it."

"If real is what you can feel, smell, taste and see, then real is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain."



What is real? How do you define real?

If you're talking about what you can hear, what you can smell, taste and feel then real is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain.
