## Networking

### DLNA - Digital Living Network Alliance
**what it is and what you need to know**

The Digital Living Network Alliance is a non-profit trade organisation, and it was started by Sony way back in 2003. The DLNA defines standards that enable devices to share stuff - photos, video, music - with each other, and it has more than 200 members responsible for more than 9,000 different DLNA devices.

DLNA and AirPlay won't talk to each other
Choosing a home entertainment platform is a bit like picking sides in a battle: there are two rival standards, DLNA and AirPlay.
AirPlay (and AirPrint) is more selective and only works on Apple or Apple-approved products.

The Digital Living Networking Alliance (“DLNA”) has dissolved and is no longer operating. This website, its contents, and certification and testing services and tools related to compliance with the DLNA Guidelines are now being provided by SpireSpark International, Inc. with permission from DLNA.

When using Bluetooth headphones, I can think of the following attacks you might be concerned about:

Traffic snooping (someone reading the data which is going over the connection, or just noticing that a connection exists at all - perhaps revealing that you're listening to something at that time)
Traffic modification (someone altering the data which is going over the connection)
Service disruption (preventing your headphones from working, probably by flooding the airwaves with random or spammy data)
Infiltration (using your PC or iPad's bluetooth capabilities to gain unauthorized access to the PC or iPad)

Bluesnarfing and Bluejacking
