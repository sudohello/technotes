IT Project Management | Measurable Organizational Value
Measurable Organization Value (MOV) is the projects overall goal and measure of success. In the IT field it must align with the organization's objective, mission, and goals.


The MOV MUST:
Be Measurable
Provide Value to the Organization
Be Agreed Upon
Be Verifiable
The MOV should be based on and support the organization's goal and strategy

There are 6 Basic Steps in developing a MOV
Identify the desired area of impact
Strategic
Customer
Financial
Operational
Social
Identify the desired value of the IT Project
Better?
Faster?
Cheaper?
Do more?
Develop an Appropriate Metric (numeric)
Time Frame for achieving MOV
Verify and Get Agreement from Stakeholders
Summarize the MOV in a clear concise statement
The project will be successful if ______
Or use a time table (in year ___ we will ____, and so on)


 where Lean and Six Sigma focus on efficient delivery, MoV is more focused on efficiency, effectiveness, and economy.

MoV helps to deliver more of the right things, for less and leads to more effective use of available resources. When times are good, the demand is to deliver more with less to remain competitive. In leaner times, the demands are for cutting costs in a manner that inflicts as little harm as possible. In some circumstances, value may be added by stopping certain activities or projects. MoV provides a way of addressing this in an objective and auditable manner.

After discussing all the problems, the action plan and MOV are created. 


**How to write MOV**
MOV - Measurable Organisational Value 

• Identify the desired area of impact - Rank the following areas in terms of importance: Strategy / Customer / Financial / Operational / Social
• With reference to your project, identify one or two of the following types of value:
        ◦ Better - is improving quality important to your client?
        ◦ Faster - does your client want to increase efficiency?
        ◦ Cheaper - is cutting costs important?
        ◦ Do more - does your client want to continue its growth?
• Develop an appropriate metric - this sets the target and expectation of all the stakeholders. It is important to determine a quantitative target that needs to be expressed as a metric in terms of an increase or decrease of money. (4 Bullet Points)
• Determine the timeframe for achieving the MOV - ask yourselves, when do we want to achieve this target metric?
• SUMMARISE THE MOV IN A CLEAR CONCISE STATEMENT OR TABLE
 (Note: the MOV should inform everyone what the project will achieve, not how it will be achieved. It should also focus on the organisation, not on the technology that will be used to build or support the information system).

**Identify the Desired Area of Impact**
The important question to answer at this point is:

* why are we thinking of doing this project?
* how the idea for the project came about?
  - the reasons could be broad and numerous (i.e., all of our competitors are doing it, it is part of our long-term strategy, we think we can make a lot of money, B2C will make our company look hip)

 the reasons for considering this project are both strategic and financial because the company wants to expand its current brick and mortar operations.

 The idea is not to neatly categorize the project, but to understand the nature of the project and how it will impact the organization.


 **Identify the Desired Value of the IT Project Once the desired area of impact is
identified**

 we can identify the value of an IT project by providing answers to the following
four questions:
• Better—What does the organization want to do better? (For example,
improve quality or increase effectiveness?)
• Faster—What does the organization want to do faster? (Increase speed,
increase efficiency, or reduce cycle times?)
• Cheaper—What does the organization want to do cheaper? (Reduce costs?)
• Do more—What does the organization want to do more than it is currently?
(Growth or expansion?2
)


1. Management by deliverables



* Test Planning
* https://www.guru99.com/what-everybody-ought-to-know-about-test-planing.html

* Action Plan
Questions Types Descriptions
What? Subject matter  What exactly do you need to do?
Why?  Purpose Why is this action critically important for achieving your vision? Why can’t you just skip it?
Where?  Location  Where will the action take place? What are other locations involved?
When? Sequence  When to start (and end) this action? When do related actions need to be started and completed?
Who?  People  Who is the best person to put in charge of this action? Who else is involved here?
How?  Method  How exactly will this action be activated?
How much? Cost  How much will this attempt cost?


Action plans are best created with small projects or projects that do not require too much collaboration.
-  used for manual project planning.

1. Set a clear Objective
- finite
- specific
- measurable
- appropriate
- realistic
- meaningful
- time oriented

2. Bottom-up Planning
- account for the deliverables first

3. Plan Deadlines
- identify tasks and deadlnes for each of these tasks to be completed

4. Monitoring

## Strategic Objective
* these are goals that will lead to a company's success
* 8 categories of strategic objectives:
  - Market Standing
  - Innovation
  - Human Resource
  - Financial Resources
  - Physical
  - Producitivty
  - Social Responsibility
  - Profit Requirement

Develop and apply the concept of a project's measurable organizational value (MOV).


1. Conceptualize and Initialize Project - Business Case
2. Develop project plan & charter - Project Charter & Plan
3. Execute and Control project - [SDLC/Agile] - Information System
4. Close Project - Final Project report & presentation
5. Evaluate Project - Project evaluations & lesson learned

* Processes: Initiating, planning, executing, controlling, closing
* Objectives: Scope, schedule, budget, quality
* Tools: Project management, information systems development
* Infrastructure: Organiational. project, technical
* Areas: Management in the areas of: Inegration, Scope, Time, Cost, Quality, HR, Communication, Risk, Procurement

* biggest challenges focus on managing multiple projects, cross-functional projects, global projects, overlapping projects, interdependent projects, project resource allocation, politics, sponsorship, and culture.

AN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROJECT METHODOLOGY (ITPM)
the methodology recommends the phases, deliverables, processes, tools, and knowledge areas for supporting an IT project.

## Phase 1: conceptualizing and initializing the project - Strategic Planning
* **where they are going!**
* **Big Picture**
* **should be doable and worth doing**

Defining goal (and getting agreement) may be the most difficult part of the methodology and the project itself.
- The project's goal, if achieved, should provide direct and measurable value to the organization.
- A project, however, will have specific objectives that support this overall goal.
  - These objectives, in terms of project's scope, schedule, budget, and product quality, are important, but not necessarily sufficient, conditions for defining the project's success or lack of success.
- A project should have only one goal, but may have several objectives.
- over all goal
- purpose must be to add tangible value to the organization.
- Alternatives that would allow the organization to meet its goal must be identified.
- Then, the costs and benefits, as well as feasibility and risk, of each alternative must be analyzed.
- Based upon these analyses, a specific alternative is recommended for funding.
- Finally, the project's goal and the analysis of alternatives that support the goal are summarized in a deliverable called the business case

1. **Define Project Goal and summarize in the deliverable report - Business Case**
  - A business case is a **deliverable**
  - It documents the project's goal, as well as several alternatives or options.
  - The feasibility, costs, benefits, and risks for each alternative are analyzed and compared, and a recommendation to approve and fund one of the alternatives is made to senior management.

## Phase 2: Develop the Project Charter and Detailed Project Plan - Tactical Planning
* **how they are going to get someplace**
* **details**
* **how it should be done**

Project Charter and detailed project plan defines how the project will be organized:
- And, how the project will be implemented
- Defines the project's **objectives** in terms of:
  * **scope**
  * **duration & schedule**
  * **cost & budget**
  * **resources & technology**
  * **approach, tools & techniques**
  * **tasks/activities**
  * **roles & responibilities**
  * **quality standards**
  * **Value for Organization**
- The project plan provides all the tactical details concerning who will carry out the project work and when

## Phase 3: Execute and Control the Project
Uses particular approach, set of system analysis and design tools to implement software development techniques
* relevant people with desired skills, experience and knowledge
* technical infrastructure, development methods and tools
* Scope, schedule, budget, and quality controls
* Risk plan
* Procurement plan for vendors and suppliers
* Quality Management Plan
* Change Management Plan
* Communication Plan
* Testing Plan
* Implementaion Plan
* HR system for evaluations and rewards

## Phase 4: Close Project
* After system has been: developed, tested, and installed - formal acceptance for transfer of control
* Final project report and presenation to document and verify that all the project deliverables have been completed as defined in the project's scope
* Final cost of the project is determined - Invoicing, Internal charges accounting
* Closing all project accounts, archiving all project documents and files and releasing project resources

## Phase 5: Evaluate Project Success
* Final Project Review
  - what went well and what could have been done better
  - lesson learned documented and shared
  - identify best practices that suits organizations processes, culture and people
* Individual Team members
  -honest and useful feeback
  - areas of strength and opportunities for improvement to be identified, plan of actions developed to develope individual's potential
* Third Eye Review
* Measurement of the Value to the Organization by evaluating the goal and objectives achieved

Computer-aided software engineering (CASE)

# Developing the Business Case
Generally focuses on imporving effectiveness and/or efficiency
* If you develop a business case in isolation, it is very likely that you will have to defend your assumptions and subjective judgments in a competitive or political setting. However, if a core team develops the business case, the critics may be more apt to argue the results rather than the data and methods used.
* **Define measurable organizational value (MOV)**
  - the project's overall goal and measure of success is referred to as the project's measurable organizational value (MOV). MOV must be:
    * Be measurable
      - provides focus in terms of actions and work towards to achieve a specific performance target
    * Provide value to the organization
      - Technology in itself cannot provide value because - Technology is only an enabler i.e. IT enables organizations to do things
    * Be agreed upon
      - clear and agreed upon sets expectations for the stakeholders
    * Verifiable
      - at the end of project, MOV must be verified to detemine if the project was a success
      * guides decisions and processes, basis for evaluating project's achievements
  - objective should be to define the problem or opportunity and then identify several alternatives that will provide direct and measurable value to the organization.
  - outline how the successful completion of the proposed project will help the organization achieve its overall mission, goals, and objectives
  - must have a clearly defined purpose and must map to the goals and strategy of the organization
* Identify alternatives
* Define feasibility
* Define total cost of ownership
  - salaries, overhead, accounting and reporting practices, training require
ments, union rules and regulations, and hiring practices.
* Define total benefits of ownership
* Analyze alternative
* Propose & supprot recommendations
* **How do we develope a project's MOV**?
  - Identify the desired area of impact. The important question to answer at this point is:
    * why are we thinking of doing this project?
    * determine how the idea for the project came about?
      - reasons could br broad and numerous i.e., all of our competitors are doing it, it is part of our long-term strategy, we think we can make a lot of money
      - identifying them will provide a background for understanding how and why decisions are made by the sponsor's organization
    * **the reasons for considering this project are both strategic and financial because:**
