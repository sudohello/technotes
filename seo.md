I am looking for advise on how to best start adopting schema.org for a real estate portal.

Would like to get feedback and suggestions on my initial thoughts.

Here are the obvious ones:

1. http://www.schema.org/RealEstateAgent(Thing > Organization > LocalBusiness > RealEstateAgent)
Plan to use this to wrap realtors' information.We ll start with their profile page but possibly also on other pages with their information (e.g. listing page)
2. http://www.schema.org/SearchResultsPage(Thing > CreativeWork > WebPage > SearchResultsPage)
This will mark search results pages where e.g. multiple listings of certain type in certain area are presented.
3. http://schema.org/WebPage(Thing > CreativeWork > WebPage)
Pretty generic so we are thinking of using it on every page. e.g. significantLinks and breadcrumb objects seem like they could help in marking important links that will help search engines understand the site's information architecture better.

the first thing and easiest would be to itemscope itemptype your business with the real estate agent classification and then add your address etc. all the basics. ( you can use your logo as a business image ). Maybe this helps in Local search, but it is difficult to tell. But it can't hurt and it is easy to do by simply wrapping the itemscope itemptype pointing to real estate sales agent in the HTML tag.
