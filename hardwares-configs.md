**Key points**
- The form factor, chipset, connectivity and price are the key attributes when picking a motherboard
- The physical size of the board
- how many memory sockets are board includes
- how fast the memory can go
- right storage connections for the SSDs and hard disks you want to install.
- PCI-Express sockets – some motherboards include full-length x16 slots that only run at 4x speed, which is no good if you want to run dual-graphics. And make sure you have enough PCI-Express x1 connectors for expansion cards

I use to work with 13Mpx to 6K, 16b raw images or video sequences. Here are the specifications I recommend for such work:
* > 16Gb RAM: it will be really important in order to be able to process a lot of data simultaneously
* Big storage space, with a size depending on what you have to store. It might be located on a shared network. My experience showed me that unless you write a lot of temporary data, SSD disk are not really useful to improve performance.
* Multi-core processor: that is important if you want to used OpenMP and to process easily some of your heaviest algorithms on several threads.
* The GPU is not really important. You just have to pick a chipset that support your favorite parallel computing platform (CUDA, OpenCL...).

That seem to be the minimum requirements in order to work with a lot of images. Sometimes, when I need to process a lot of images with very complex algorithm destined to be hard coded on an ASIC chip, I need more power. Therefore I send jobs on about ten computers all night and get the resulting images the next morning.

So laptop wise I would find the cheapest nvidia gtx 1080 laptop

However, if you want to train lots of small networks, or do some basic training before deploying your training script on a heavy machine, and are hell bent on buying a laptop for training, I’d suggest you buy a gaming laptop.

Asus and Acer have good options here. You can run Linux on it like a pro.
These have decent GPUs, and give you good performance for training small networks.
This is more convenient than setting up an external GPU on another laptop.

## PCIe vs Thunderbolt
http://www.tested.com/tech/457440-theoretical-vs-actual-bandwidth-pci-express-and-thunderbolt/
1. **PCIe - PCI Express**
  - what exactly does it mean when you have a PCIe 2.0 x8 connection?
  - And does it make a difference whether your connection is x8 or x16?
  - PCIe slots of different physical sizes and also different PCIe generations.

* A physical PCIe x16 slot can accommodate a x1, x4, x8, or x16 card, and can run a x16 card at x16, x8, x4, or x1.
* A PCIe x4 slot can accommodate a x1 or x4 card but cannot fit a x16 card. 

**What is PCIe**

A PCIe connection consists of one or more data-transmission lanes, connected serially. Each lane consists of two pairs of wires, one for receiving and one for transmitting. You can have one, four, eight, or sixteen lanes in a single consumer PCIe slot--denoted as x1, x4, x8, or x16. Each lane is an independent connection between the PCI controller and the expansion card, and bandwidth scales linearly, so an eight-lane connection will have twice the bandwidth of a four-lane connection. This helps avoid bottlenecks between, say, the CPU and the graphics card. If you need more bandwidth, just use more lanes.

Gigatransfers per second (GT/s)

**Maximum Theoritical PCIe x.x lane throughput**
* A single PCIe 1.0 (or 1.1) lane can carry up to 2.5 (GT/s) in each direction simultaneously.
* For PCIe 2.0, that increases to 5GT/s
* A single PCIe 3.0 lane can carry 8GT/s.

**After overhead, the maximum per-lane data rate**
* PCIe 1.0 is eighty percent of 2.5GT/s. That gives us two gigabits per second, or 250MB/s (remember, eight bits to a byte). The PCIe interface is bidirectional, so that's 250MB/s in each direction, per lane.
* PCIe 2.0 doubles the per-lane throughput to 5GT/s, which gives us 500MB/s of actual data transfer per lane.
* PCIe 3.0 lane, at 8GT/s, can send 985MB/s. That's not quite twice 500MB/s, but it's close enough for marketing purposes.

**Encoding**
- PCIe 1.* and 2.0 use 8b/10b encoding (like SATA does),  they lose 20 percent of their theoretical bandwidth to overhead
- PCIe 3.0 and above use a more efficient encoding scheme called 128b/130b, so the overhead is much less--only 1.54 percent

- What that means is that a PCIe 3.0 x4 connection (3.94GB/s) should have nearly the same bandwidth as PCIe 1.1 x16, or PCIe 2.0 x8 (both 4GB/s)
- Modern GPUs use a x16 PCIe 2.0 or 3.0 interface. That doesn't mean they always run at x16 speed, though.

Many motherboards have multiple physical x16 slots, but a smaller number of actual of PCIe lanes available
- On a Z87 (Haswell) or Z77 (Ivy Bridge) desktop, the CPU has 16 PCIe 3.0 lanes.
- Intel chipsets have an additional eight PCIe 2.0 lanes, but those are typically used for sound cards, RAID cards, and so forth.

2. DDR3 vs DDR4
3. PSU

* make sure that your processor actually supports PCIe 3.0 if you have a motherboard with PCIe 3.0.

**Thunderbolt**
Thunderbolt is a data transfer interface that can pass through both PCI Express and DisplayPort signals, depending on what it is plugged into. 
A Thunderbolt controller consists of two bidirectional data channels, with each channel containing an input and an output lane. The Thunderbolt chips on each end of the cable take in both DisplayPort 1.1a and a four-lane PCIe 2.0 bus. Each channel is independent, and can either carry DisplayPort or PCIe, but not both. Each direction in each channel has a theoretical maximum throughput of 10Gbps--the same as two PCIe 2.0 lanes.

so the maximum theoretical throughput of a single Thunderbolt channel is 1GB/s in each direction. 

## PCIe Lanes

Your m.2 drive will use the chipset lanes and will not be handicapped at all.  Your GPU can run at 16x.  Even if for some reason it couldn't (which it can) 8x is more than enough for your GPU.  There is no way a 1070 can saturate 8x PCIe 3.0.

**Intel 8700**
* You get 16 full-speed PCIe lanes from the CPU:
* Paired with a Z370 board, you also get a further 24 PCIe lanes from the chipset
* Note that the chipset lanes all share a higher latency ~x4 PCIe 3.0 link to the CPU. So although it's great for things like networking and one or two high speed NVMe drives, those chipset lanes aren't optimal for anything ultra-performance sensitive like GPUs.

**Intel 8700K**
* PCI Express Revision 3.0
* PCI Express Configurations ‡ Up to 1x16, 2x8, 1x8+2x4
* Max # of PCI Express Lanes 16

**Maximum Theoritical PCIe x.x lane throughput**

A single PCIe 1.0 (or 1.1) lane can carry up to 2.5 (GT/s) in each direction simultaneously.
For PCIe 2.0, that increases to 5GT/s
A single PCIe 3.0 lane can carry 8GT/s.


**After overhead, the maximum per-lane data rate**

PCIe 1.0 is eighty percent of 2.5GT/s. That gives us two gigabits per second, or 250MB/s (remember, eight bits to a byte). The PCIe interface is bidirectional, so that's 250MB/s in each direction, per lane.
PCIe 2.0 doubles the per-lane throughput to 5GT/s, which gives us 500MB/s of actual data transfer per lane.
PCIe 3.0 lane, at 8GT/s, can send 985MB/s. That's not quite twice 500MB/s, but it's close enough for marketing purposes.

**[What-is-the-difference-between-the-PCIe-lanes-from-the-CPU-and-the-ones-from-the-motherboard-Is-there-a-performance-difference](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-the-PCIe-lanes-from-the-CPU-and-the-ones-from-the-motherboard-Is-there-a-performance-difference)**
- The pcie lanes for the cpu are the maximum amount of pcie lanes supported on the motherboard. The long pcie slots on the motherboard are x16, and the only pcie devices (with exceptions) that use this amount of bandwidth are gpu’s. So a single gpu takes up 16 lanes, if your cpu is a 28 lane then you now have 12 lanes left.

* **Have you heard of m.2, u.2, and esata?**
	- They all use x4 pcie 3.0 lanes
	- So if you then have two m.2 drives and one u.2 drive on top of your graphics card you are now using 28 pcie lanes, which is the max the cpu can handle.

* **Well what if you add more pcie devices?**
	- The motherboard will automatically restrict the bandwidth for some devices (in the motherboard manual it will tell you which ports will be effected and when).
	- This means that if you have two graphics cards with a 28 lane cpu, since this takes up 32 lanes, the motherboard will only allow x8 bandwidth to both cards.
	- This is a problem with newer cards since they need the full x16 bandwidth, and is partly the reason people are saying “sli is dying”. It doesn’t effect performance a lot, but enough that if you’re doing sli you want to make sure you have a 40 lane cpu.

* the pcie lanes for the chipset are for lower bandwidth devices, such as usb ports and audio cards
* This shows how the chipset pcie lanes get 8gbs and 6gbs
* while, the cpu pcie x16 lanes get 15gbps. This is because everything using cpu pcie lanes are devices that interact directly with the cpu no matter what. 
* The chipset lanes are all devices that can interact with the cpu sometimes, but also interact with the storage and external devices.
* So yes there is a perfomance difference, the cpu lanes get more priority and bandwidth, and the chipset lanes are lower bandwidth.
* Chipset lanes are typically used for things like M.2 storage, capture cards, or other peripherals that use pcie lanes
* For the DMI ( Direct Media Interface ), with 3 version the chipset will support DDR4, more pcie lanes, and more USB3.0 etc. more info https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Media_Interface


**If we add single GPU, does it use PCI E lanes from the chipset or from the processor?**
- the GPU, which can only be plugged in your motherboard's single PCIe x16 slot, uses the x16 lanes coming from the processor.

* Both cards are "binned" in the sense that they're guaranteed to run at a certain clockspeed out of the box but GPU Boost 3.0 mostly negates that. Overclocking potential will always be dependent on the silicon lottery.

**Intel Core i7 vs Xeon**
So, should you go with a Core i7 or Xeon processor? It really comes down to what you are using your system for. If you are planning on using your system for gaming, home or business use, the i7 will be the better option for you. However, if you are looking for a high-powered system to run video rendering or 3D software, you may want to look into getting a Xeon.

## RAM

**What is ram module**
A memory module is another name for a RAM chip. It is often used as a general term used to describe SIMM, DIMM, and SO-DIMM memory. While there are several different types of memory modules available, they all serve the same purpose, which is to store temporary data while the computer is running.Feb 11, 2008
Memory Module Definition - The Tech Terms Computer Dictionary
- https://techterms.com/definition/memorymodule

This is because most computers only accept one type of memory. Therefore, if you decide to upgrade you computer's RAM, make sure the memory modules you buy are compatible with your machine.

## HDD,SSD,SsHD

**Hard Disk - HDD**
* What is better a Sshd or HDD?
SSHD stand for solid-state hybrid drive. It's a traditional hard disk with a small amount of solid-state storage built in, typically 8GB or so. The drive appears as a single device to Windows (or any other operating system), and a controller chip decides which data is stored on the SSD and what's left on the HDD.Apr 10, 2017

**SSD vs SSHD**

**HDD Cache**
WHAT IS HARD DRIVE CACHE AND WHAT DOES IT DO?
https://www.pcmech.com/article/what-is-hard-drive-cache-and-what-does-it-do/
main hard drive specs, like capacity, read/write speeds, and platter rotation speeds

Hard drive cache is often known as the disk buffer. By that name, its purpose becomes a little more clear. It acts as temporary memory for the hard drive as it reads and writes data to the permanent storage on the platters.

You can think of a hard drive’s cache as being like RAM specifically for the hard drive.

- z270 supports full overclocking, maximum PCIe lanes


## PSU - Power supply unit
- PCIe connectors of your PSU are able to support a 8pin+6pin connector with one cable.
- You can calculate the required watts by adding up the watt of your CPU and GPUs with an additional 100-300 watts for other components and as a buffer for power spikes.
- Another important thing is to buy a PSU with high power efficiency rating – especially if you run many GPUs and will run them for a longer time.
- Your motherboard should have enough PCIe ports to support the number of GPUs you want to run (usually limited to four GPUs, even if you have more PCIe slots); remember that most GPUs have a width of two PCIe slots, so you will need 7 slots to run 4 GPUs 
- PCIe 2.0 is okay for a single GPU, but PCIe 3.0 is quite cost efficient with respect to cost-performance even for a single GPU; for multiple GPUs always buy PCIe 3.0 boards which will be a boon when you do multi-GPU computing as the PCIe connection will be the bottleneck here.
- The motherboard choice is straightforward: Just pick a motherboard that supports the hardware components that you want.
- When you select a case, you should make sure that it supports full length GPUs that sit on top of your motherboard. Most cases support full length GPUs, but you should be suspicious if you buy a small case. Check its dimensions and specifications; you can also try a google image search of that model and see if you find pictures with GPUs in them.


EPS 8-pin power connectors

The RM850x and RM1000x are fully modular power supplies sporting an 80 PLUS Gold certification and 100% Japanese capacitors. The RM1000x in conjunction with the Noctua fans made for an incredibly quiet dual Xeon server and most of the time the power supply was in “Zero RPM Fan Mode” which was nice.

- http://www.guru3d.com/articles-pages/geforce-gtx-1080-ti-review,7.html
Here is Guru3D's power supply recommendation:

Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Ti  - On your average system the card requires you to have a 600~650 Watts power supply unit.
If you are going to overclock your GPU or processor, then we do recommend you purchase something with some more stamina. And remeber, a PSU is the most efficient at 50% load. So if you use 400 Watts on average (SLI), the most energy friendly powersupply would be an 800 Watt model. There are many good PSUs out there, please do have a look at our many PSU reviews as we have loads of recommended PSUs for you to check out in there.

**What could happen if your PSU can't cope with the load is:**
- Bad 3D performance
- Crashing games
- Spontaneous reset or imminent shutdown of the PC
- Freezing during gameplay
- PSU overload can cause it to break down

The 80 PLUS program tests computer power supplies for efficiency at 20%, 50% and 100% loads. Initially, power supplies only needed to be 80% efficient to earn certification. Over the years as power supplies became more and more efficient, new standards such as Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum were created.

**Number of PINS**
one 6-pin and one 8-pin
https://forum-en.msi.com/index.php?topic=280978.0
When a video board says 8+6 for power requirements it means one 8-pin connector and one 6-pin connector from your power supply. Take on PCI-E 6+2 connector from your PSU and use it for the 8-pin connector on the video board. Take another 6+2 connector and only use the 6-pin part in the 6-pin socket on your video board. I hope I explained that well enough.

## Coolers, Cooling
- Cooling is important and it can be a significant bottleneck which reduces performance more than poor hardware choices do.
- You should be fine with a standard heat sink for your CPU, but what for your GPU you will need to make special considerations.
- Modern GPUs will increase their speed – and thus power consumption – up to their maximum when they run an algorithm, but as soon as the GPU hits a temperature barrier – often 80 °C – the GPU will decrease the speed so that the temperature threshold is not breached. This enables best performance while keeping your GPU safe from overheating.
- The easiest and most cost efficient work-around is to flash your GPU with a new BIOS which includes a new, more reasonable fan schedule which keeps your GPU cool and the noise levels at an acceptable threshold (if you use a server, you could crank the fan speed to maximum speed which is otherwise not really bearable on a noise level).
- You can also overclock your GPU memory with a few MHz (30-50) and this is very safe to do. The software for flashing BIO is a program designed for Windows, but you can use wine to call that program from your Linux/Unix OS.
- The other option is to use to set a configuration for your Xorg server (Ubuntu) where you set the option “coolbits”. This works very well for a single GPU, but if you have multiple GPUs where some of them are headless, i.e. they have no monitor attached to them, you have to emulate a monitor which is hard and hacky.

## TF card vs SD Card
* https://www.techora.net/tf-card-and-microsd-card.html
* https://www.techykeeday.com/tf-card/


Before that SanDisk, Matsushita, Toshiba agreed to develop and market the SD card. The card was derived from the Multimedia Card and provided digital rights management. It was designed to compete with the Memory Stick, a DRM product that SONY had released a year before. Then came the miniSD form as a small factor extension to the SD card standard. Along with mini SD came mini SDHC supporting some devices only. Since 2008, miniSD were no longer produced and MICRO SD paved their way.


Secure Digital (SD) cards were launched in 1999 by Panasonic, Toshiba having the ability to store encrypted music data. 
It is a non-volatile memory card format developed by the SD card association.

SD includes 4 card families available in three different sizes. The four are the original Standard-Capacity (SDSC), the High-Capacity (SDHC), the extended-Capacity ( SDXC), and the SDIO, which combines input/output functions with data storage.

The three form factors are the original size, the mini size, and the micro size.

The SD card’s small footprint is an ideal storage medium for smaller, thinner and more portable electronic devices.

Initially, their size varied from 1MB TO 125MB. SDHC being less than 2GB and greater than 32 GB. But now their size varying up to 32 GB offering a large amount of storage space to store your files and documents. Also, these cards are reusable such that when any content is copied from PC to card that can be easily deleted and can be copied again.

CARD SECURITY
Cards can protect their contents from erasure or modification, prevent access by non –authorized users, and protect copyrighted content. Also, the data can be erased and even copied again as and when required.

COMMAND TO DISABLE WRITE
The host device can even command the SD card to become read only. There is both reversible and irreversible host that commands this.

Also, while talking about other SD cards TransFlash memory card definitely makes their way in. Now the other question which arises is “What the main diff. btw TF Card and microSD Card?

**“The microSD removable miniaturised secure Digital flash memory cards were originally named T –Flash or TF, also commonly called TransFlash.”**

The storage capacity of TF card varies from 128 MB, 256 MB, 512 MB, 1GB, 2GB, 4 GB, 6GB, 8GB, 16 GB, 32 GB and 64 GB as well

TF card or TransFlash card is generally used for its micro secure digital cards and was considered to be the world’s smallest memory card. Both the cards are very much alike and can be used in place of one other but there is a little dissimilarity which sets them different from each other.

* MicroSD cards can perform non-memory jobs such as GPS, Bluetooth and near field Communication. But a TransFlash cannot do such non-memory jobs.
There is also a switch on security segment in SD card whereas no such feature is found in TransFlash.
The volume of SD card is comparatively more than TF card.
TF card can support 64 GB as well which microSD card doesn’t.

The size of the TF Card is available up to around 128 GB and SD Card is available in the size up to 2 TB.

Most of the mobile phones or Smartphones used the technology of Micro SD Card rather than TF Card.
